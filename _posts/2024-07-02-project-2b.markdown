description: In this map, only the properties with an area of less than 2000 square metres were compared. Patterns of higher and lower greenness are evident. High-resolution imagery and ground truth inspection can be used to develop and test hypotheses regarding the observed patterns. This information can be invaluable for planning and monitoring purposes.
