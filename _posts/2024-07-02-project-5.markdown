description: Applying a machine learning algorithm (Support Vector Machine) to a remote sensing dataset produced this land cover classification map for the Mudgee region study. Urban areas are pink, wooded areas dark green and crops are mid-green. A map from twenty years earlier was produced using the same techniques, then the two maps were compared to produce a matrix of class changes. Information such as this is useful in detecting urban growth and changes to rural land use.
