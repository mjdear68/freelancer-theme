description: For this major project, a 36-year Landsat time series was developed for a portion of the Blue Mountains National Park, NSW. The objective of the study was to evaluate and quantify the response of different vegetation communities to major ecological disturbances, particular fire. This series of images shows the seasonal greenness of the study area following a major fire in 1994. The burnt areas are shown in red.
