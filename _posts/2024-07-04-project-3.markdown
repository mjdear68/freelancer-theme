description: Remote sensing change detection was applied to an area on the edge of the Grose Valley in the Blue Mountains National Park, NSW to determine the changes in vegetation cover following the major fires in December 2019. The map in this image represents the areas in which vegetation cover has changed between 2019 and 2023. Red indicates an increase in sparse vegetation and bare ground following the fires. The change map is overlayed on a true colour image of the area from 2019.
