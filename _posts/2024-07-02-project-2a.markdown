description: This project combined satellite remote sensing data with a property boundary geospatial dataset to give a greenness classification to each property in this suburb of the Blue Mountains, NSW for January 2024. Oranges and reds indicate a lower greenness relative to the other properties in the study area, whereas darker greens indicate relatively higher greenness.
