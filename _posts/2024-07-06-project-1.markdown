description: Hunter River Estuary, NSW, Australia. This false colour composite image was produced using the Near Infrared, Shortwave Infrared and Red bands from Landsat 5, September 2003. Darker shades of orange, red, and brown indicate woody vegetation; lighter shades indicate pasture and green grassy vegetation. Shades of green indicate senescent vegetation. Purples, pinks and light blues indicate buildings and developed areas. Dark blues and black indicate deep water. The long black rectangles in the south-east of the image are coal stockpiles. The Hunter Estuary was investigated on behalf of Birdlife Australia due to the area's significance as a wetland and shore bird species habitat.
