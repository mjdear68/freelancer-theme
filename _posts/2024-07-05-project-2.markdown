description: A remote sensing change detection technique was applied to a suburban area and then combined with a property boundary geospatial dataset to produce this map which displays the change in greenness for each land parcel over a twelve-month period. Oranges and reds indicate a stronger reduction in greenness relative to the average for the area, whereas green shades indicate a larger increase than the average. The red dots indicate positions where there has been a strong decrease in greenness, possibly due to the removal of vegetation. This map would be of value to councils and other organisations responsible for monitoring land cover change.
