        <p>After completing the Graduate Diploma of Education (Secondary Mathematics) with the University of New England, Australia in 2004, I worked until December 2023 as a teacher of mathematics with the NSW Department of Education. In my teaching career I completed numerous data analysis projects related to student achievement, attendance, and well being, which provided insights to school managers that were used to inform decision making. I also helped establish my school's Data Team which included developing training materials for teachers and delivering professional development workshops.</p>
        <p>From 2021-2024 I undertook the Graduate Diploma in Applied Statistics with the University of New England, Australia. During this course, I completed a remote sensing research project in which I used a 36-year Landsat NDVI time series to investigate the response of vegetation to ecological disturbances in the Blue Mountains National Park, NSW. Since graduating from this course, I have developed my skills in remote sensing for land cover mapping and change detection through volunteer work with <a href="https://birdlife.org.au/">Birdlife Australia</a>, and I continue to develop my skills in other areas of data analysis by completing professional development courses such as &#x275D; Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python &#x275E; (IBM) and &#x275D; Introduction to Git and Github &#x275E; (Google).</p>
        <p>I am currently working part-time with the NSW Department of Education as a teacher and pursuing a career as a freelance data analyst.</p>
