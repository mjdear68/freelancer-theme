        <p>After completing the Graduate Diploma of Education (Secondary Mathematics) with the University of New England, Australia in 2004, I worked until December 2023 as a teacher of mathematics with the NSW Department of Education. In my teaching career I completed numerous data analysis projects related to student achievement, attendance, and well being, which provided insights to school managers that were used to inform decision making. I also helped establish my school's Data Team which included developing training materials for teachers and delivering professional development workshops.</p>
        <p>From 2021-2024 I undertook the Graduate Diploma in Applied Statistics with the University of New England, Australia. During this course, I completed a remote sensing research project in which I used a 36-year Landsat NDVI time series to investigate the response of vegetation to ecological disturbances in the Blue Mountains National Park, NSW. Since graduating from this course, I have developed my skills in remote sensing for land cover mapping and change detection through my work with Birdlife Australia, and I continue to develop my skills in other areas of data analysis by completing further <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mjdear68/details/certifications/">professional development courses</a>.</p>
        <p>I am currently working part-time with the NSW Department of Education as a teacher and pursuing a career as a freelance data analyst.</p>
